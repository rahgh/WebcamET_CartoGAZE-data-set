# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the experiment conducted as part of the research titled "Use Cases and Limitations of Webcam Eye Tracking for Cartography Research," a Master's thesis at the University of Salzburg, UNIGIS program.
The experiment, accessible [here](https://rahgh.github.io/WebcamET_CartoGAZE-data-set/), aimed to collect online eye-tracking data...
, aimed to collect online eye-tracking data using webcam technology and consists of three sets of memorability tasks (blocks) focused on recognizing different landmarks, totaling 30 map stimuli.

- **Block 1:** 10 map stimuli focusing on the memorability of main roads and road junctions.  
- **Block 2:** 10 map stimuli focusing on the memorability of major water bodies and rivers.  
- **Block 3:** 10 map stimuli combining elements from the first two blocks to assess their collective memorability. 

This project seeks to advance the development of low-cost, accessible eye-tracking systems, fostering innovation in human-computer interaction, assistive technologies, cognitive research, and cartographic applications.
