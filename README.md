Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the experiment conducted as part of the research titled "Use Cases and Limitations of Webcam-Based Eye Tracking for Cartography," a Master's thesis at the University of Salzburg, UNIGIS program. The experiment, accessible here, aimed to collect online eye-tracking data using webcam technology and consists of three sets of tasks (blocks), totaling 30 map stimuli. The structure of the blocks is as follows:

Block 1: 10 map stimuli focusing on the memorability of main roads and road junctions.
Block 2: 10 map stimuli focusing on the memorability of major water bodies and rivers.
Block 3: 10 map stimuli combining elements from the first two blocks to assess their collective memorability.
This project seeks to advance the development of low-cost, accessible eye-tracking systems, fostering innovations in human-computer interaction, assistive technologies, cognitive research, and cartographic applications.
